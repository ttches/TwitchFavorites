This project is part of FreeCodeCamp.com where I am assigned to use the Twitch.tv API to display streamers

Sometimes this needs to be reloaded to work. I really wanted to practice vanilla
JavaScript for this assignment and so I had to make little hacks to get everything
working asynchronously with the limits of the API without breaking CORS.
